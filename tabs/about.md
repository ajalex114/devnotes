I am a fun loving, talkative, friendly person. I love technology, and how it empowers everyone. Crazy about gadgets. I am into Music, Photography and Cars.  
I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at **Microsoft**.  

A brief look at my career.  
I have worked at various companies since _2011_, and been having a lot of fun ;).

Here is a look at my career.

* **Infosys Technologies Limited** : _(August 1 2011 - July 1 2014)_  
I was part of _Mobility Unit_. Having worked on few interesting projects as a .Net developer, playing around with _C#_.

---------------------

* **Oracle India Pvt. Ltd.** : _(July 7 2014 - February 8 2018)_  
I was part of _Identity Management (IDM)_ at Oracle. After having worked on their _On-Prem_ solution for almost an year, I moved to _**Oracle Cloud**_, where I played around with all the fancy terms like _Microservices_, _Active Directory_, etc. developing using both _Java_ and _C#_ technologies.

---------------------

* **GlobalLogic** [for client **Ericsson**] : _(February 12 2018 - July 7 2018)_  
A short stint at _GlobalLogic_, having worked for _Ericsson_ on their cloud based media platform namely _Media First_ gave me my first exposure to _Asp.Net Core_. My major chunk of work was to migrate the existing Asp.Net application to Asp.Net Core.

---------------------

* **Microosft** : _(July 16 2018 - January 14 2022)_  
I was part of _Supply Chain Engineering_ at Microsoft. I was working on _.Net Core_ based applications, (obviously).  
As part of this org, I have put my signature in the manufacturing process of Microsoft hardwares which includes Surface, XBox, Hololens and other Microsoft accessories.  
Every Microsoft hardware you use or see around has gone through more than one process where I have contributed to it.  
If you have a Surface device with you, the serial number on it is most probably my contribution.  
How cool is that!

-------

* **Google** : _(January 17 2022 - April 15 2024)_  
At Google, I am part of Google Cloud Platform or GCP in short. I  contributed to the infrastructure side of GCP. You probably won't get to see the work that I do as a GCP feature, but you probably will not be able to enjoy using GCP without what we do here. ;)  
_So, what did I do here?_  
In simple language, any time Google Cloud comes with a new region or expands an existing region, I was part of it.  
There will be some team which procures the servers, another team that installs it in the data centers, another that installs the basic services on it.  
I have the requirements from different products/teams within Google Cloud on what kind of machines they need or what is the amount of CPU or RAM that they need. I would now go look at the machines available, sort them out for each teams as per their need. Assign it to them. That's it.  

---------------------

* **Microsoft** : _(May 27 2024 - Present)_  
With the happy feeling of being back at Microsoft, I joined a different team this time. This time around, I'm part of the Engineering Systems team at Microsoft.  
I'm working on powershell, yaml and pipelines with the Azure Linux team. The work I do makes the Azure experience more seamless and efficient.
If you've heard of Azure Boost, my work enables the implementation underneath it.

Well, life is more than just career. More about _me_:

* **Music**  
I've been into _music_ since my childhood. Having born into a family where everyone has some bit of _music_ in their life one way or another.  
And, as for me, I'm into _Musical Instruments_.  
I am majorly a keyboardist.  
I started playing keyboard for the church choir in my 4th standard.  
I have also put my hand into Guitar and Drums, but I'm no expert at either.  
_Rythums_ excite me. Be it _drums_, or any sort of _percussion instruments_. I enjoy beating rythm on the _table_, or on _myself_ or _anywhere_ that makes sound.  
I am part of a _Gospel Band_ named _[Deo Gratias](https://www.facebook.com/DeoGratiasband/)_. 

----------------------------------

* **Photography**  
I've liked _photography_ ever since I was at school, although I didn't have a _camera_ back then. I would get my friends' camera and take pics anytime I got a chance. I was the man behind the _camera_ for many of the short films that we did while at college.  
I now have a _Canon EOS 700 D_ to play around with.  
I have uploaded a few of my pics here at [500px](https://500px.com/alenalex114) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/alenalex114/) and my personal photography blog at https://alenspics.webflow.io/.
